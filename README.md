# snoring-formants
This repo contains an Matlab program to extract formants* from snoring audio files.  
*formants: a concentration of acoustic energy around a particular frequency in the speech wave  
This is part of the final project of the Biosignal Processing course (HCMIU VNU-HCMC, Feb - Jun 2021).  

## What the program does:
1. Load snoring sound and perform spectral analysis
2. Filter with Normalized Least Mean Square policy
3. Extract formants with a Hamming window
